 * four separate fields (`User::whereApiToken($token)->first()` per field, per
 * row) and counted applies/likes/dislikes/comments with a query each — roughly
 * eight extra queries per post on a paginated feed. Here the viewer arrives
 * once on the request and every count is an eager-loaded `withCount`.
